It is the centerpiece of Kinabalu Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site renowned for its outstanding universal values and as one of the world's most important biological sites. The mountain and its surrounding park are a biodiversity hotspot, boasting an incredible array of endemic flora and fauna, including unique pitcher plants, orchids, rhododendrons, and a rich diversity of bird species.\\n\\nThe primary draw for tourists is the challenging yet highly rewarding climb to Low's Peak, the mountain's summit, typically undertaken over a two-day, one-night itinerary.

Beyond the summit trek, visitors can explore the park's extensive lowland trails, marvel at the Poring Hot Springs, or partake in the thrilling Via Ferrata experience (the highest in the world).

Its unique topography features dramatic drop-offs just meters from the shore, creating a vibrant ecosystem brimming with marine life.\\n\\nDivers from around the globe flock to Sipadan for its unparalleled biodiversity and guaranteed encounters with large pelagic species. Highlights include the famous 'barracuda tornado' – massive schools of barracudas swirling in a captivating formation – as well as swirling schools of jackfish, reef sharks (including hammerheads and grey reef sharks), and an abundance of green and hawksbill sea turtles. The island is often referred to as a 'turtle haven' due to the sheer number of turtles found here, often seen resting in underwater caves or gliding gracefully along the reefs. Other common sightings include bumphead parrotfish, giant trevallies, manta rays, eagle rays, and a vast array of colorful reef fish and vibrant corals.\\n\\nTo preserve its pristine environment, Sipadan Island is a strictly protected area.
